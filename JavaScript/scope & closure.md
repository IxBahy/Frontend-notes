# Scopes and closure

some people said JavaScript has 2 scopes others said 3 and frankly some said 4 !! all are right but we have to understand as every programming language JS has two main scopes (Global,Local) and the Local scope consist of 2 other scopes (Function,Block) so in a more programmaticly way

```js
javaScriptScopes = {
	Global,
	Local: {
		Function,
		Block,
	},
};
```

so what are some uses of the scopes or why it's important to understand them for 2 reasons in my opinion :

- for memory reasons : so you can now know when you make a variable when will it not be reachable and then the garbage collector removes it after your done using it.

so for example if you will write a for loop like this

```js
let i = 0;
for (i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
	console.log(i); //=> log the value of each iteration
}
console.log(i); // will log a 10
```

but if it was written like this

```js
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
	console.log(i); //=> log the value of each iteration
}
console.log(i); // will give an error
```

why will it give an error that's because the GC did it job and removed the 'i' from the memory as soon as the block ended

if I told you if we use var in the second case it will not be collected by the GC and will stay at the memory if dont understand why check my article about the var keyword. LINK HERE

- to understand more of the code security what can be accessed at the current scope and what can't it's not good to have every variable avilable throughout the hole app

### Global Scope

all what you need to know is that variables outside a function are declared in the global scope with only one thing to keep in mind. if you used 'var' to declare a variable in the global scope it will be assigned to the window object but if you declared it with 'let' it wont be assigned to it.

```js
var a = 5;
let b = 2; // Global variable
function doSomething() {
	//Local Scope
	return a + b; //Global variable can be accessed anywhere
}

console.log(window.a); // 5
console.log(window.b); // undefined
```

### Local Scopes

there are two kinds of local scope:

#### Function Scope:

each time you create a function a new scope for it is created all the variables declared at the function are reachable by all the code inside it and as soon as it ends they no longer accessible

we might think of many cases and questions of nesting functions and variables on different levels we will take about all this later

I just want you to know tha basics about scopes first so you wont get overwhelmed

#### Block scope

was introduces with the ECMAScript6 with the let and const with it now we can declare variables in loop and if statments using let or const only and after the block ends the variables are cleared from memory using the GC.

## Lexical Environment

Enviroment is an isolated area of code {} defined a new local enviroment in the code and when done executing it should be removed so what is a lexical enviroment ? first we have to understand the lexical scope

#### Lexical scope

whne we have a nested group of function with each having it own enviroment if we will execute the following code:

```js
let a = 7;
let b = 10;

const multiplier = () => {
	let a = 5;
	return a * b;
};

multiplier(); // 50
```

the engine will first search in the local scope for both the variables "a & b" it will find the variable "a" in it but the variable "b" is absent so will search for it in the parent scope 'in this case the global scope' and it will use it from there.

this is called the **Scope Chain** it helps to resolve variables
